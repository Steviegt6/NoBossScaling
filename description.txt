Adds a server-side config for handling the scaling of stats in multiplayer with Expert Mode or Master Mode enabled.

All configurable stats:
 * Health
 * Damage
 * Defense
 * Size
 * Knockback Resistance

All of these stats can be disabled globally. You can preserve scaling for specific NPCs through whitelists in the config. There is a global whitelist and a whitelist provided for each specified stat.
